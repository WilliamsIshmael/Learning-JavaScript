// STRICT MODE

`The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".`
`Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.`

// FUNCTIONS 
`A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Start with the 'function' keyword then follow with the name of the function.`

function speaker() {
  console.log('Hello, I am the speaker')
}

speaker(); 
speaker(); 
speaker(); 

// Parameters in functions
`Parameters are variables that you list as part of a function definition. 
They act as placeholders for values that will be passed to the function when it is called.`

function addNumbers(a, b) { 
return a + b; 
} 

`a and b are parameters.`

console.log(addNumbers(10, 23)); 

`10 will take the place of a and 23 will take the place of b.`

// ARRAYS
