/*
The Documents Object Model (DOM) is the data representation 
of the objects that comprise the structure
and content of a document on the web. 

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements). 
HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.
